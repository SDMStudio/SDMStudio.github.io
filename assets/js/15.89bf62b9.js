However, little is known about how partial information sharing affects existing theory and algorithms. This paper addresses this question for a team of two agents, with one-sided information sharing‚Äî\\ie both agents have imperfect information about the state of the world, but only one has access to what the other sees and does. From the perspective of a central planner, we show that the original problem can be reformulated into an equivalent information-state Markov decision process and solved as such. Besides, we prove that the optimal value function exhibits a specific form of uniform continuity. We also present a heuristic search algorithm utilizing this property and providing the first results for this family of problems.

Here we show how it can apply to (infinite horizon) 2-player zero-sum partially observable stochastic games (zs-POSGs) by (i) taking a central planner's viewpoint, which can only reason on a sufficient statistic called occupancy state, and (ii) turning such problems into zero-sum occupancy Markov games (zs-OMGs). Then, exploiting the Lipschitz-continuity of the value function in occupancy space, one can derive a version of the HSVI algorithm (Heuristic Search Value Iteration) that provably finds an-Nash equilibrium in finite time."}}),e._v(" "),i("Publication",{attrs:{title:"Template",authors:"Names",date:"2021",url:"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03080287",abstract:"Abstract example."}})],1)}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
